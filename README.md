# Hi, I'm Prem Ganesh Maddirala! ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I'm a motivated graduate student pursuing a Master of Science in Data Science and Analytics at Arizona State University (Expected June 2026), with a specialization in Computing & Decision Analytics. I hold a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science from Birla Institute of Technology & Sciences, Dubai (June 2022).

With a strong foundation in data analytics, automation, machine learning, and digital transformation, I've led cross-functional teams, delivered client-facing solutions, and implemented real-world projects that simplify processes and drive efficiency. My experience spans product strategy, RPA implementations, data visualization, and AI/ML model development. I'm passionate about turning complex data problems into user-friendly, impactful solutions through collaboration and innovative thinking.

I'm actively seeking opportunities in **Software Engineer (AI/ML)** roles and **Data Analyst** positions. Let's connect if you're working on exciting projects in these areas!
